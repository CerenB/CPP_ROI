This folder - for the time being - will be used for Moebius Project's ROI
The folder path setting should be done in a way, we use:
- up-to-date bids matlab
- up-to-date CPP-ROI repo functions
- bidspm functions are not defined
- pathways for the input files are set to MoebiusProject 


When we transition completely to the new version of bispm (with bidsmatlab functions)
Then we can leave this repo and delete/carry this folder.
